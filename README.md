### I made gif search app using React Native.
Do you want to dive into GIPHY, and it's online database and search for short looping videos with no sound that resemble animated GIF files. Then you are in right place. Go to 'Giphy Page!' then press blue button 'Click Here to search GIF'. Search bar will show up. Enter your favorite keywords to search gifs. From favorite singers to favorite animals. Also feel free to use React Native navigation buttons to go back and forward through pages.
